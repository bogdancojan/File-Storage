# 📁 Document Management System

This project is a **simple document management system** built with **Ruby on Rails**. It empowers users to upload, download, and delete documents. The documents are securely stored in a database, ensuring that when a document is deleted, all its associated records are also meticulously removed. 

The user interface, constructed with Rails views, includes features such as a JavaScript confirmation dialog for deletions and dynamic display of content based on the presence of documents.

# 🛠️ Rake Tasks

In addition to the web interface, this project includes a set of **Rake tasks** that allow you to manage documents from the command line. These tasks provide a robust alternative to the web interface and do not require the Rails server to be running.
